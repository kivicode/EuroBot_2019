Task,"Напишите программу that in the sequence of natural numbers determines the sum of the numbers that are multiples of 6.
 The program takes on input the number of numbers in the sequence, and then the numbers themselves.
 In the sequence is always a number that is a multiple of 6.
 The number of numbers less than 100.
 Input number does not exceed 300.
 The program should print a single number — the sum of the multiples of 6.
 ","Напишите программу that in the sequence of natural numbers determines the number of multiples of 4.
 The program takes on input the number of numbers in the sequence, and then the numbers themselves.
 In the sequence is always a number that is a multiple of 4.
 The number of integers not exceeding 1000.
 Input number does not exceed 30 000.
 The program should print one integer — the number of multiples of 4.
